## Introduction To the assignment

Our assignment is to develop a simple TicTacToe program using the technical infrastructure to support agile development. With the end goal of gluing together the project into a coherent ifrastructure rather then implementing complicated features. 

The group consists of the following 7 students:

## Programming rules 

* All code should be readable. 
* Every class should have a comment that specifies the purpose of the class in general terms. 
* All classes, functions, and variables should have descriptive names. 
* Functions should have camelCasing while Constants are declared with capital letters. 
* If in doubt check out the [Java programming style guidelines](http://geosoft.no/development/javastyle.html) 


## Protocol 
 
* Code that is committed must build and run
* Before pushing code on Github it should be tested with gradle. 
* When code is commited it should a descriptive comment of the code that is commited.
* When code is pushed from branch to master a pull request should be made.  
* A branch should be made to implement each feature. 
* Pair programming is used during the process of code development.
